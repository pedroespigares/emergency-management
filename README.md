# Emergency management in python
This python project is an OOP program connected with a SQLite database which allows you to manage the different emergencies that may arise in a hospital. There is not GUI

Folders are in Spanish, I'm sorry ðŸ˜…. However, all files and code are written in English.

The use of the program is quite simple, since it only interacts with the database. 

It is called with EmergencyManagement.py and has the following parameters:

<ul>
  <li>-pacients</li>
  <li>-urgency</li>
  <li>-medics</li>
  <li>-actuations</li>
</ul>

Each of these parameters has its own parameters, which will call different functions of the program, 
such as displaying all the patient data or search by name, for example:

Each branch of the program has its own functions, which will be output as an error message if the program call is not written correctly.
